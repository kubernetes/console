# i18n & l10n in Dashboard

This document describes the fundamental aspects of providing i18n & l10n support in the Dashboard project.

## i18n

The process of *internationalization* (i18n) requires the abstraction of all locale-specific application bits, so that they can be later properly populated with information for the given locale. Internationalization means writing the code in a way that it can be adapted to a locale easily.

## l10n

The process of *localization* (l10n) calls for mechanisms which can provide translation (and localized data) for the abstracted bits in the *i18n* step. Localization means actually adapting the application to the given locale (e.g. translating the text).

Usually this step is done by translators. If the text which is to be localized is provided in a suitable format (i.e. XLIFF), a translator could use a translation program to efficiently do the localization. This is the best possibility. The other option is to directly translate the abstracted bits inside of a simple file (e.g. JSON file).

## Approaches
So far I have considered 2 possible approaches to localization:
  * *Closure Templates* (Soy) - this approach creates multiples sets of .js files (e.g. `translation_de.js`, `translation_en.js`), which are pre-compiled and then served individually with respect to the locale. It requires build steps for this and can be integrated nicely in our build pipeline. A static solution, because the whole page must be re-served if the locale changes.

  * *Angular Translate* - this is, in contrast, a dynamic solution. All the translations are loaded dynamically on the client side, there are no multiple pre-compiled files. It is written entirely based on AngularJS. However, the abuse of *data bindings* make it more demanding performance-wise. Locale changes are possible without reload.

Note that locale changes are actually pretty rare.

For a bit more detailed information on the two approaches, refer to the following docs:
* Closude Templates - https://github.com/taimir/dashboard/blob/i18n-closure-soy/docs/design/i18n-soy.md
* Angular Translate - https://github.com/taimir/dashboard/blob/i18n-angular-translate/docs/design/i18n-angular-translate.md

These two tools are also the ones discussed in the following design document of AngularJS and are right now the two prominent options for i18n & l10n for AngularJS in the near future. Refer to the document at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mwyOFsAD-bPoXTk3Hthq0CAcGXCUw-BtTJMR4nGTY-0
